# HNG Internship Stage 1 Task: Multi-Page Portfolio Website
This project is a multi-page personal portfolio website created as part of the HNG Internship Stage 1 task. It builds upon the initial single-page task by adding two new pages (to [task 1](https://github.com/Mueenah1/HNG0)-[Homepage](https://mueenah1.github.io/HNG1/)):  an "About Me" page and a "Contact Us" page with client-side form validation. The entire site is designed with a focus on semantic HTML, accessibility, and responsive design.
## Live Demo
- You can view the live version of the project here [HNG](https://mueenah1.github.io/HNG1/)
## Features
	- Multi-Page Navigation: A clean and consistent navigation bar to switch between the Home, About Me, and Contact pages.
	- Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
	-	Accessible Contact Form:
		Includes labels correctly associated with all input fields.
 		 -	Implements client-side validation for all required fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message).
 		 -	Provides clear, accessible error messages and a success message upon valid submission.
		 -	Utilizes ARIA attributes (aria-describedby) to link errors with their respective inputs.
	-	Semantic HTML: The project uses semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.) for better structure and accessibility.
	-	Data Test IDs: All required elements include data-testid attributes for automated testing purposes, as specified in the task requirements.
	-	Keyboard Navigation: The entire website is fully navigable using only a keyboard.
## Tech Stack
This project was built using core web technologies:
	-	HTML: For the structure and content of the web pages.
	-	CSS: For styling, layout, and responsiveness (including Flexbox and media queries).
	-	JavaScript: For client-side form validation and DOM manipulation.
## Project Structure
The project consists of three main pages:
	1.	Home Page (index.html): The main landing page that introduces the project and provides navigation to the other pages.
	2.	About Me Page (aboutMe.html): A reflective page sharing personal information, goals for the program, and other thoughts, structured with semantic sections.
	3.	Contact Us Page (contactUs.html): Contains a functional contact form with real-time validation to ensure all data is correctly entered before submission.
